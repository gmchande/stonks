// The quote feed: every symbol asked for goes in one run, one curl over one
// connection, and a run's answers land together. Hand it the members, what
// is watched, and what is due; read quotes, entries, and asks back. The
// panel never touches a Process.
//
// Two lanes, one run each at a time: first answers (a symbol with no
// answer this session) and refreshes, so an add never waits behind a
// refresh. The pill's symbol (`lead`) goes first in a run. A run still
// going after 20 s is stopped, and its host counts as not answering.
//
// An entry is this symbol's last answer: { status, receivedAt, answeredAt },
// on the service's clock. "ok" or "failed" for the latest answer, or
// "saved" for a quote kept from an earlier session until its first answer;
// receivedAt is the last usable answer and survives failures, so a failed
// row still shows its last price; answeredAt is the last answer of any
// kind, which the service schedules by.
//
// `asked` holds each symbol asked for and not yet answered, with the second
// it was asked: freshness calls one overdue after 90 s. What came back
// decides (`Fetch.answerKind`): a bad answer is tried again 2.5 s later,
// three tries in all, then failed; a missing symbol fails at once; a
// refusal or no answer at all is the host's, not the symbol's, so it stays
// asked and the gate pauses every feed on that host.
