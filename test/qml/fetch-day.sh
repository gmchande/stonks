# The daily totals, by hand (test/all.sh leaves it out: it takes minutes):
# a weekday and a weekend of glances through the real Service and App on a
# clock the harness sets (fetch-day.qml), with a long list's shape, 34
# symbols. Counts every request the fake curl answered and every curl call,
# and estimates the bytes both ways from the measured sizes: a new
# connection's TLS handshake, 8.25 KB; headers, 0.8 KB on it and 0.4 KB on
# each request after; a day's chart compressed, 2.9 KB (2.4 measured
# mid-morning on 8 October, 3.5 to 3.9 for a full day); Robinhood's prints,
# 6.0 KB a listing compressed, scaled to the list's 33 listings; a history,
# 15 KB; cap and P/E, 1.5 KB; instruments, 2 KB.
