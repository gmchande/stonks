# The one way a test starts Quickshell (lib.sh's run_qs, render.sh), sourced
# by lib.sh and by crash-check.sh, which proves it with a stand-in.
#
# Quickshell's crash handler is off (QS_DISABLE_CRASH_HANDLER, Quickshell
# 0.3.1's src/launch/launch.cpp:154). On a crash it forks a child that dumps
# the core under its own pid, forks a crash reporter window (a bare
# `quickshell`) in the same process group, and starts Quickshell again in the
# crashed pid, which more than 10 s after launch reruns the harness from the
# top into the same log, where it can pass (src/crash/handler.cpp:58-159,
# src/launch/main.cpp:27-75). Off, a crash is the pid we started dying on its
# signal, its core filed under that pid.
#
# Each run is a process group of its own, which ends with the run, and
# everything it starts carries the run's mark (STONKS_RUN, procs.sh), so
# what left the group is found by the mark, never by name: the owner's shell
# and other runs are Quickshells too. The group's leader is a small shell,
# marked too, that starts Quickshell, reports how it ended, and then holds
# the group, shrugging off TERM, until the run kills it: so the group is
# known to be the run's until its last member is stopped, a child that
# cleared its environment included, and its number can't have passed to
# another group.
#
# Each run has a runtime folder of its own, which goes with the run, so a
# test's Quickshell leaves nothing in the session's: Quickshell 0.3.1 puts
# each instance's folder and its links (by-id, by-pid, by-shell, by-path,
# vfs) under $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/quickshell, and nothing removes them
# (src/core/paths.cpp, baseRunDir, which reads XDG_RUNTIME_DIR alone). The
# run's folder links every entry of the session's but quickshell, so
# Wayland, Hyprland, the bus, and the rest answer as before.
