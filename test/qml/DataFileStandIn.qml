// notice, and the read's end in that order: Quickshell's own read can't be
// held part-way. Keeps what Quickshell 0.3.1's FileView does
// (src/io/fileview.cpp): a read starts as the path is set; a reload() while
// a read is in flight is ignored (loadAsync); a write is skipped when it
// equals the text in hand (setText), and drops a read in flight unheard,
// neither loaded nor failed (saveSync's cancelAsync). Here a read sees the
// file as it is when it starts.
