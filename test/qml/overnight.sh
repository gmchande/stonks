# Overnight prices through the real Service, feeds, and App window, on a
# clock the harness sets: which listings Robinhood is asked for, when, and
# for which span; the 1D chart as one New York calendar day, midnight to
# midnight, on a weekday, a weekend, and Sunday night; search's preview of a
# symbol in All and of one not yet added; the overnight line under the price
# and its dimming; a scrub of the night leaving the rows on now; none for a
# symbol that has not traded tonight, an index, or a cryptocurrency, none at
# the weekend; a failed answer asked again; the first live night's lone
# print, drawn and scrubbed in both looks, and its line on 1M at rest and
# scrubbed; a night held open across midnight, the chart staying on
# Tuesday until Wednesday's first print, then measured from Tuesday's close
# at rest and scrubbed; and two names Robinhood does not trade all day,
# PSIX and BLDP, with no overnight line from a stray night trade, Yahoo's
# own day laid out a print a step from the left edge, keys stepping print to
# print, and SPY on Yahoo's day while Robinhood's instruments are down;
# exchange times named by zone for a reader in New York; and an index with
# no pre-market, no tail after its close, and its next open. HOME
# and curl are scratch; the fake curl answers from test/fixtures/overnight.
