# The popup's card edge in motion through the real Panel and Service with
# real Qt keys, judged on rendered frames: a list switch either way, the key
# sheet closing, a removal and its undo, an add that lands, a membership
# change from elsewhere, and the list menu each ease the edge in 160 ms with
# the footer riding it whole; an open from closed holds its fitted height.
# The shell's layer-shell card window does not load offscreen, so the copy
# of Panel.qml puts the card in CardWindow.qml, a plain window. HOME and
# curl are scratch.
