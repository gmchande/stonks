# The one shared chart range through the real Service, App, and BarWidget: a
# range picked in the window, the pill showing the day on every range in
# every style, the window's hold while a range's history is out or failed,
# expired history arriving while it refetches, r (and its day-old cap and P/E),
# the window opened and closed by the pill's right-click and by IPC, against
# the popup and another workspace, real IPC refreshing once for two pills
# and reaching the plugin with no pill at all, a range left behind never
# retrying, no history fetched with no surface open, the pill's first-fetch
# states, and later Services reading back the saved range, with a window
# summoned before each was ready, and the hero holding what it showed while
# a range or symbol loads. HOME and curl are scratch.
