# The fetch policy through the real Plugin, Service, App, and two pills, on a
# clock the harness sets: requests per listing at each moment against each
# market's cadence, with nothing open and with the window open, for a busy
# stock, a thin one, an ETF, an index, a cryptocurrency, London, Tokyo at
# lunch, and Toronto; an offline start on saved quotes and the network's
# return; an open that finds the rows fresh; r twice; Yahoo refusing and
# recovering; a network back within seconds; a list past the budget; the
# pill's wheel; an add, a removal and its undo; a search's preview; and, in a
# second run, a US holiday while London and Toronto trade. HOME and curl are
# scratch; the fake curl answers from test/fixtures/overnight/fetch-2026-10-07
# and sweep-2026-10-07-1455.
